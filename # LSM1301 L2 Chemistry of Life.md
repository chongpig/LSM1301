# LSM1301 L2 Chemistry of Life
## 1. Organic Molecules
### 
* Contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms
	Linked by covalent bonds
	may also be bonded to other atoms
* Each carbon atom
	Able to bond with up to four atoms
	By single, double or triple bonds
* Carbon atoms 
	Ablee to form chains or rings
### Function groups
Clusters of atoms linked to carbon skeleton
Confer specific chemcal properties to molecules : Reactivity, Polarity
### The four types of organic molecules
* Carbohydrates, Proteins, Lipids, Nucleic Acids
* Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers
	* A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks
	* These small building-block molecules are called monomers
* Three of the four classes of life's organic molecules are polymers: Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids
* Synthesis of Polymers
	* Monomers are joined rogether through dehydration synthesis
* Breakdown of Polymers
	* Polumers are broken apart through hydrolysis
## Carbohydrates
* Composition:
	* C, H, O in ration of 1:2:1
	* Chemical formula $(CH_2O)_n$ _
	* Single sugar : monosaccharide
	* Two sugar : disaccharide
	* Several(3-10) sugars : oligosaccharide
	* Many sugars : polysaccharide
* Function: Energy source and structral support
* Single sugar molecule : eg. Glucose, ribose, deoxyribose, fructose, galactose
	* Most have 5 or 6 carbon backbone
		5 carbon sugars : pentoses
		6 carbon sugars hexoses
	* Usually in ring form in cells
	* Soluble in water
* Disaccharide:
	* Sucrose(table sugar) = glucose + fructose
	* Lactose(milk sugar) = glucose + galactose
	* Maltose(malt sugar) = glucose + glucose
* Polysaccharides
	The designation alpha means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the $-CH_2OH$ group at C-% lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane(a trans arrangement), while beta means that they are on the same side of the plane(a cis arrangement)
	Leaf: Cellulose(beta)
	Potato: Starch(alpha)
	Liver: Glycogen(alpha)
	* Starches:

## Protein
Proteins are polymers composed of building blocks called amino acids
* Function: Structural , Movement, Defense, Storage, Signaling, Catalyzing reactions
* Amino Acids: Hydrogen, Amino, Carboxyl, "R"
* Protein Synthesis
	* Joined by condensation
		Carboxyl(-COOH) group of ine amino acid with amino(-NH2)group of the next amino acid
		$H_2O$ formed as by-product
	* Result in peptide aas by-product
* Four levels of protein structure:
	1. Primary: consists of a linear sequence of amino acids linked together by poptide bonds
	2. Secondary: the chain twists into a coil, or pleated sheet held by hydrogen bonds
	3. Tertiary: refers to complex foldings of the protein chain held togethere by hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges , and other bonds
	4. Quaternary: in which two or more multiple polypetide chains associate as linked together by hydrogen bonds or disulfide bridges
* The functions of proteins are linked to their three-dimensional structures:
	Precise postioning of amino acid R groups leads to active site and binding site
	Disruption of secondary and tertiary bonds leads to denatured proteins and loss of function
## Lipids 
Organic substances which are insoluble in polaar solvents , such as water. Include : triglycererides(fats and oils), phospholipids, waxes, and steroids
* Fatty acid lipids/ Non-Fatty Acid Lipids
1. Triglycerids(Oils, Fatss):
	Are used primarily as energy-storage molecules, containing twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins
	Are formed by dehydration synthesis
	Three fatty acids + glycerol -> triglyceride
	Saturated fat: mostly all C-C bonds
	Unsaturated fat : many C=C bonds
2. Phospholipids
	The major component of all cell membranes
	Subunits
		One glycerol
		Two fatty acids non-polar and hydrophobic
		Head with phosphate group, polar and hydrophilic
	Formed by condensation
3. Steroids
	Steroids are composed of four carbon rings fused together, with various functional groups protruding from them 
	eg: Cholesterol, Bile salt(cholic acid)

Three principles comprise cell theory:
* Every living things or organisms are made of one or more cells.
* Cells are functional units of multicellular organism.
* All cells come from pre-existing cells.
### Types of cells

### Transport of Substance  Across Membranes
1. Passive transport: no energy required:
	* simple diffusion
	* facilitated diffusion (require protein transporter)
2. Active transport: energy-requiring transport 
	* Such as sodium-potassium pump proteins
### Diffusion
* Diffusion
Net movement of molecules down a concentration gradient (high to low concentration)
* Osmosis – special case of diffusion
Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane down its own concentration gradient
From high water (low solute) concentration to low water (high solute) concentration
### Movement of water across membranes by osmosis
* Isotonic solution
Solute concentration equal on both sides of membrane
* Hypotonic solution
Solute concentration lower than on other side of membrane
* Hypertonic solution
Solute concentration higher than on other side of membrane
### Facilitated difussion
Facilitated diffusion (facilitated transport)
Ions and polar molecules
No energy required
Follow their concentration gradients
Transport proteins (conformational change) required
Specialised water-channel proteins, aquaporins, enhance water transport
### Active Transport
The movement of materials across a membrane through the use of cellular energy, normally against a concentration gradient
Active transport is performed by specific proteins (pump) embedded in the membranes
Active transport allows cells to maintain concentration gradients that differ from their surroundings
   e.g. keep a low concentration of Na+ inside cell even the 
   Na+ concentration is very high outside cell.
### Exocytosis/Endocytosis
* Large substances are transported into or out of cell inside membrane enclosed pouches (vesicles)
Macromolecules and particles too large for transport proteins
Formation and movement of vesicles involve motor proteins and ATP
* Exocytosis
Vesicle fuses with plasma membrane, releasing contents outside cell
* Endocytosis
Small patch of plasma membrane pinched off, forming vesicle, engulfing substances near cell surface, bringing them into cell
### Cell wall

### prokayotic cells structure
* Cell envelope:
Cell wall – polysaccharides in bacteria, proteins in archaea
Glycocalyx – polysaccharide coating outside cell wall – slime layer and capsule (harder to remove)
Plasma membrane
* Appendages
Flagella – in some bacteria for motility
Fimbriae (attachment pili) – bristle-like, short and abundant, for adhesion to surfaces
Conjugation pili (sex pili) – tubular, long and fewer, for DNA transfer from cell to cell

## 4.Eukaryotic Cells
* Much larger than prokaryotic cells 
* DNA in a nucleus that is bounded by a membranous nuclear envelope 
* Membrane-enclosed organelles result in compartmentalisation
Specialised organelles for specific functions
Types and amounts of substances that enter and exit organelles regulated

Metabolic reactions isolated from others
### Nucleus
* Control center of the eukaryotic cell (stores DNA)
* Three major components
Nuclear envelope (double membrane)
Chromatin
Nucleolus (carrying genes for ribosomes production)
### Chromatin and Chromosome
Consists of DNA and proteins
Chromatin condenses to form chromosomes during cell division
Chromatin are long thin fibres, but chromosomes are compacted, thick and ribbon-like.
They contain genes that provide a blueprint for a huge variety of proteins
### Chromosomes
* Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus
* Somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) have two sets of chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. 
* Gametes (Gametic cells, reproductive cells: sperm and eggs) have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells
### Endomembrane System (Cell’s Membrane System)
* Components of the endomembrane system:
Nuclear envelope
Endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi apparatus/complex
Lysosomes
Vacuoles
Plasma membrane
* These components are either continuous or connected via transfer by vesicles/vacuoles
* Functions: 
Synthesizes, modifies, and transports proteins
Synthesizes lipids
Detoxifies the cell of certain toxins
### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
* A network of sacs and tubules composed of membranes. This complex organelle originates at the nuclear envelope and winds throughout the cell. 
Two forms
* Rough ER:Flattened sacs
Studded with ribosomes on outer surface
Synthesises, modifies and folds proteins
* Smooth ER
Series of inter-connected tubules
No ribosomes
Synthesises lipids (like steroid hormones made from cholesterol)
Detoxify harmful chemical drugs
### Golgi Complex/Apparatus

	clean up broken down organelles, bacteria virus
* Structure:
	vesicles of digestive enzymes
### Energy-related Organelles
Mitochondria:The sites of cellular repiration, a metabolic process that generate ATP. function as the powerhouses of the cell
* Mitochondria are in nearly all eukaryotic cells (plant and animal).
* They have a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane folded into cristae.
* Cristae present a large surface area for enzymes that synthesize ATP.
* The inner membrane creates two compartments: intermembrane space and mitochondrial matrix.
* Cellular respiration broke down carbohydrate in the mitochondrial matrix to generate high-energy electron carriers, e.g. NADH.
* The electron transport chain complexes in inner membrane transfer electron from NADH to O2 and generate ATP.

Chloroplast: found in plants and algae are the sites of photosynthesis
Both organelles have their own DNA
* Chloroplasts are only found in plant cell.
* Thylakoid membranes contains chlorophyll pigment that carry out light reaction converting light energy to chemical energy, e.g. ATP
* Stroma is the site for dark reaction, using ATP to synthesize carbohydrate from CO2 and water.
### Cytoskeleton
* Microfilament is comprised of actin and provide internal support to the cell shape.
* Microfilament can extend by adding subunits at one end and releasing subunits at the other end to allow cell movement.
* Microtubule is associated with motor proteins to transport organelles within the cell.
* Microtubule also guide chromosome movements during cell division.

# L4 Energy

## 1.1 Energy – the capacity to do work
* Two fundamental forms of energy
	* Kinetic energy – energy of motion being used to do work
	* Potential energy – stored energy to do work
* One form of energy can be converted to another form
	* Plants trap energy from sun via photosynthesis and convert it into chemical bond energy
	* All organisms use energy stored in bonds of organic compounds to do work
* Energy stored in chemical bonds – type of potential energy

## 1.2 
* Autotrophs
autos = self; trophe = nutrition 
Self-feeders, producers
Plants capture light energy to make food – photosynthesis

* Heterotrophs
heterone = (an)other 
Other-feeders, consumers
Organisms acquire energy from molecules of other organisms

## 1.3 Metabolic reactions
* Metabolism
	* Sum of chemical reactions in cell
* Reactants
	* Chemical substances that enter a chemical reaction
* Products
	* Chemical substances that form as result of a chemical reaction
* Chemical reactions can be categorised based on energy gain or loss
	* Endergonic reactions
	* Exergonic reactions

* Endergonic Reactions 
	Require an input of energy
	Products contain more free energy than reactants
	Example – photosynthesis
* Exergonic Reactions
	Net release of energy
  	Products contain less free energy than reactants
  	Example – cellular respiration

* Metabolic reactions occur in sequences – metabolic pathways
	Products of one earlier reaction become reactants of another later reaction
	Catalysed by enzymes (biological catalysts)
	Each reaction requires a unique and specific enzyme
* Catabolism
	Breakdown of complex molecules such as food
	Produces energy (exergonic)
* Anabolism
	Synthesis of complex molecules
	Uses energy (endergonic)
## 1.4 Enzymes
* Enzymes are catalytic compounds that drive biochemical reactions in living systems. The majority of enzymes are proteins.
* Enzymes orient, distort, and reconfigure molecules in the process of lowering activation energy
* Activation energy is the minimum energy required to start a chemical reaction.
* Some enzymes require helper (coenzyme) molecules to function (e.g. B vitamins, metal ions).
* Enzymes are very specific for the molecules they catalyze.
* Enzyme activity is often enhanced or suppressed by their reactants, products and buffer conditions.

* Enzyme Structure
	* Enzymes have a pocket called an active site
	* Reactants (substrates) bind to the active site
	Distinctive shape of active site is complementary and specific to the substrate (lock and key)
	Active site amino acids bind to the substrate and distort bonds to facilitate a reaction

* Enzymatic Action
	* The active site is flexible, not rigid
	* The shape of the enzyme, active site, and substrate adjust to maximize the fit, which improves catalysis. 
	* There is a greater range of substrate specificity

## 1.5 Energy carrier Molecules
* High-energy, unstable molecules
	* Synthesized at sites of exergonic reactions
	* Capturing some released energy
	Most common: 
	Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)

* ATP
	* ATP links endergonic to exergonic reactions through coupled reactions
		* Energy released by exergonic reaction used to combine relatively low-energy 			adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (P) into ATP
		* Energy captured in high-energy bonds of ATP
	* ATP used to drive endergonic reaction
		* Where energy is needed, ATP is broken down into ADP and P
		* Stored energy is released
	* phosphoanhydride bonds
	* ATP – short-term energy storage
		* Not stockpiled in cells
		* Recycled at furious pace
		* Long-term energy storage molecules –triglycerides, starch and glycogen

* Electrons
	* Energy can be transferred to electrons in metabolic pathways
		E.g. cellular respiration, photosynthesis
	* High-energy electrons then passed from one molecule to another –oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions
		Oxidation – loss of electrons
		Reduction – gain of electrons
	* Both oxidation and reduction reactions occur at same time – one molecule accepts electrons given up by another
		Molecule that gives up electrons is oxidised
		Molecule that accepts electrons is reduced
		$NAD^+ + H^+ + 2e^- ↔ NADH$
		
	* Electron carriers transport high-energy electrons
		E.g. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
	* Electron carriers then donate high-energy electrons to other molecules – membrane-		embedded proteins in mitochondria and chloroplasts
		Electron transport chain
	* Leads to synthesis of high-energy ATP
		Left with low-energy electrons
	
* Energy release
	* During photosynthesis – energy of sunlight captured, stored in the form of glucose
	* Glucose produced during photosynthesis
		Consumed and broken down by nearly all organisms
		Energy captured in the form of ATP
	* Main metabolic pathways to generate ATP from glucose breakdown
		Aerobic pathways (need O2)
		Anaerobic pathways (no O2)
	* Aerobic pathways
		Require oxygen
		Used by most eukaryotes
		E.g. aerobic cellular respiration
	* Anaerobic pathways
		Do not require oxygen
		Used by prokaryotes and protists in anaerobic habitats
		E.g. anaerobic respiration, fermentation
	
## 1.6 Aerobit Cellular respiration
* Usually involves breakdown of glucose to CO2 and H2O
* Energy extracted step-wise from glucose – allows for efficient production of ATP
	Electrons removed from intermediates, received by oxygen, which combines with hydrogen 		ions (H+) to become water
	Electrons carried by NADH (reduced form of NAD+) and FADH2 (reduced form of FAD)

* Aerobic cellular respiration: 4 stages
1. Glycolysis (occur in cytoplasm, no O2 needed)
2. Converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
	Occurs in cytoplasm (in prokaryotes)
	Occurs in matrix of mitochondria (in eukaryotes)
3. Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle or TCA cycle)
	Occurs in cytoplasm (in prokaryotes)
	Occurs in matrix of mitochondria (in eukaryotes)
4. Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation
	Occurs in plasma membrane (in prokaryotes)
	Occurs in inner membrane of mitochondria (in eukaryotes)

* Breathing vs Respiration
	* Breathing: taking air in (inspiration) and out of your lungs (expiration); can be consciously controlled (voluntary action)

	* Respiration: the part of a metabolic process; cellular activity (occurs inside a cell); the end products are energy molecules, carbon dioxide and water; cannot be consciously controlled (involuntary action)
		Aerobic respiration (when oxygen is available)
		Anaerobic respiration (metabolism without oxygen)

* Glycolysis
	* Breakdown of one glucose (6-carbon) molecule
		Into two pyruvate (3-carbon) molecules
		Net yield of two ATP and two NADH molecules
	* Consists of 10 reactions
	* Does not require oxygen
	* Occurs in two stages
		Energy investment stage (activation stage)
		Energy harvesting stage

* Two stages in Glycolysis
	* Energy investment stage
		One glucose (6-carbon) molecule is split into two 3-carbon molecules
		Phosphate groups added to the 3-carbon molecules
		Phosphorylation results in more reactive molecule – glucose is relatively stable
		Two ATP molecules used to activate one glucose molecule
	* Energy harvesting stage
		* Conversion of phosphorylated 3-carbon molecules to pyruvate molecules
		* Phosphorylated 3-carbon molecules oxidised by removal of electrons and H+
		* Electrons and H+ accepted by NAD+ resulting in high-energy electron-carrier 			molecule NADH
		* Two phosphorylated 3-carbon molecules produced per glucose molecule – two 			NADH molecules formed
		* Two ATP molecules generated by substrate-level phosphorylation for each molecule 			of pyruvate produced
		* Two pyruvate molecules produced per glucose molecule - 4 ATP molecules 				generated
		* Two ATP molecules used to activate one glucose molecule – net gain of two ATP 		molecules

* Formation of Acetyl CoA
$Pyruvate + CoA + NAD^+ -> CO_2 + acetyl + NADH + H^+$
2 NADH and 2 CO2 produced for each glucose, No ATP generated

* Krebs cycle:Each turn:
	2 CO2
	1 ATP
	3 NADH
	1 FADH2
	* The Krebs cycle begins by combining acetyl CoA (two-carbon) with a four-carbon molecule 		to form six-carbon citrate, and coenzyme A is released.
	* As the Krebs cycle proceeds, enzymes in the matrix break down the acetyl group, 			releasing two CO2 molecules and regenerating the four-carbon molecule for use in future 	cycles.
	* Each acetyl group produces one ATP, three NADH, and one FADH2
	* Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a high-energy electron carrier similar to NAD, picks up 		two electrons and two H+, forming FADH2
	* CO2 is generated as a waste product. CO2 diffuses out of cells and into the blood, which 		carries it to the lungs, where it is exhaled
	* One glucose molecule needs two cycles to break into CO2

* From glycolysis, acetyl-CoA formation and citric acid cycle
	* High-energy electrons captured by NAD+ and FAD
	* For every glucose molecule, ten NADH and two FADH2 produced

* NADH and FADH2 release electrons to electron transport chain
	* Electron transport chain – series of electron carrier proteins
		In eukaryotes – embedded in inner mitochondrial membrane
		In prokaryotes – embedded in plasma membrane
	* High-energy electrons passed successively from one protein to another, losing small amounts of energy at each step

* Energy lost by electrons harnessed by electron transport chain proteins to pump H+ from matrix into inter-membrane space
* Higher H+ concentration in inter-membrane space
gradient created
* H+ flows down its gradient through ATP synthase, which drives synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate
	Chemiosmosis – ATP production linked to establishment of H+ gradient
* Oxygen accepts electrons and combines with H+ to form water
Final electron acceptor – oxygen

* Net yield per molecule of glucose
	Glycolysis – 2 ATP
	Citric acid cycle – 2 ATP
	Electron transfer phosphorylation – 32 or 34 ATP
	The reason for two different numbers exist for ATP synthesis is because of two different 		shuttles for NADH (from glycolysis) transfer from cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix.
## 1.7 Fermentation
* When there is no oxygen after glycolysis, fermentation will occur
	Processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate NAD+ from NADH are collectively referred to as fermentation.
	Do not break glucose down completely to carbon dioxide and water
	Yield only 2 ATP from glycolysis
* Lactate fermentation
	In animals or bacteria – produces lactic acid
* Alcoholic fermentation
	In yeast – produces ethanol

* What Happens During Lactate Fermentation?
	* Carried out by muscle cells, certain bacteria and fungi
	* Produces lactic acid
	* NAD+ regenerated after NADH transfers electrons to pyruvate
	* Used in production of cheese, yoghurt, sour cream and sauerkraut
* What Happens During Alcohol Fermentation?
	* Carried out by microorganisms such as yeasts under anaerobic conditions
	* Produces CO2 and ethanol
	* NAD+ regenerated to accept more high-energy electrons during glycolysis
	* Used in production of alcoholic spirits and breads
* Fermentation
	Input : glucose, 2ADP, 2P
	Output: 2 lactATE/2Alcohol+2CO2
## 1.8 Food and Energy
* Starch and other complex carbohydrates
	Broken down to monosaccharide subunits that enter glycolysis
* Fats (triglycerides) broken down to glycerol and fatty acids
	Glycerol enters glycolysis
	Fatty acids converted to acetyl-CoA that enter citric acid cycle
* Proteins broken down to amino acid subunits
	Usually used to build proteins but may be used as energy source
	Amino group removed and converted into waste product eliminated in urine
	Remaining carbon groups converted to acetyl-CoA, pyruvate or intermediates of citric cycle, depending on amino acid

# L5 DNA and Heredity

## 1. What is DNA
* Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid or DNA is a long chain of nucleotides
Nucleotides are the monomers (building blocks) of nucleic acid chains
All nucleotides are made of three parts:
	Phosphate group 
	Five-carbon sugar
	Nitrogen-containing base

* DNA:	DeoxyriboNucleic Acid
  RNA:	RiboNucleic Acid

* DNA chain are formed by condensation

* To rule out the possibility that a protein contaminant was actually causing the transformation, Avery treated samples with protein-destroying enzymes (protease) and still induced transformation
When DNA-destroying enzymes (DNase) were added to the samples, transformation did not occur
This suggested that the transforming molecule from the S-strain was DNA, not protein

* The experiments can be explained if DNA is the transforming agent
Heating S-strain cells killed them but did not completely destroy their DNA
When killed S-strain bacteria were mixed with living R-strain bacteria, fragments of DNA from the dead S-strain cells was absorbed and incorporated into the chromosome of the R-strain bacteria
If these fragments of DNA contained the genes needed to cause disease, an R-strain cell would be transformed into an S-strain cell
Thus, Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty concluded that genes are made of DNA.

* Used radioactive isotopes to label two sets of phage
Radioactive sulphur 35S to label protein
Radioactive phosphorus 32P to label DNA
Allowed labelled viruses to infect bacteria
Location of radioactive labels after infection
shown that DNA, not protein, enters and infects bacterium

* The relative amounts of A, G, T, and C bases in a DNA molecule varies from one species to another (i.e. differs in different DNA molecules)
The number of A is equal to T
The number of G is equal to C

* Watson-Crick Model
DNA consists of two nucleotide chains (two strands)
In opposite directions (antiparellel)
Double helix
Resemble a ladder twisted around its axis
Each rung consisting of a pair of bases
Deoxyribose and phosphate units linked together alternately into sugar-phosphate backbone
Hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases 
A=T
C≡G

* How Does DNA Encode Information?
How can a molecule with only four simple parts be the carrier of genetic information?
The key lies in the sequence of nucelotides
Within a DNA strand, the four types of nucleotides can be arranged in any linear order, and this sequence is what encodes genetic information
The genetic code is analogous to languages, where small sets of letters combine in various ways to make up many different words
The sequence of only four nucleotides can produce many different combinations

* Chromatin vs Chromosome
Both are structures within living cells that contain the genetic material. 
Biochemically, chromosomes are composed of
DNA, which is the genetic material
Proteins, which provide an organized structure

* Gene vs DNA
	A gene is a specific sequences of nucleotides, is a basic physical and functional unit of 		heredity, usually corresponding to a single protein or RNA

* Dominant genes will show phenotypic trait when homozygous or heterozygous
Recessive genes will only show phenotypic trait when homozygous

* DNA Replication
	* Begins when DNA unwinds and unzips into two strands
		1. By DNA helicases, that pull apart the parental DNA double helix at the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs.
		2. Hydrogen bonds between bases broken
		3. Formation of replication bubbles and replication forks
	* Short RNA primer synthesised first to provide 3' end for DNA polymerase
		* Primer is synthesized by RNA polymerase (Primase) 
		* A typical primer is about five to ten nucleotides long. The primer primes DNA synthesis, i.e., gets it started.
	* Each old strand serves as template for synthesis of new strand
		* By DNA polymerases
		* Based on complementary base-pairing rule
	* DNA polymerase adds nucleotides in 5' to 3' direction only.
		* Can only join new nucleotide to free 3' end of previous nucleotide.
	* Leading strand synthesised continuously
	* Lagging strand synthesised in short fragments
		* Okazaki fragments
		* Joined together by DNA ligase
	* Semi-conservative replication
		Each strand of double helix acquires a new strand
		Each “old” parent strand serves as template for complementary “new” daughter strand
		Each new DNA molecule is half “old” and half “new”
	
* Mitosis: 1 diploid cell to 2 diploid cells
  Meiosis: 1 diploid cell to 4 haploid cells
  Independent assortment allow 223 combinations of 23 pairs of chromosomes in human gametes

* DNA mutation
	* A mutation is a change in a cell’s DNA sequence, either in a protein coding gene or in a noncoding regulatory region.
	* Mutations may have varying effects on function
		* Mutations are often harmful, and an organism inheriting them may quickly die
		* Some mutations may have no functional effect
		* Some mutations may be beneficial (rarely) and provide an advantage to the organism in certain environments
			These advantageous mutations may be favored by natural selection and are the basis for evolution of life on Earth

* How do mutations occur
	* Mistakes do happen: DNA is altered or damaged in a number of ways
		* Mistakes are made during normal DNA replication
		Replicated DNA strands usually contain only about one mistake in every 100 million to 1 billion base pairs
		* Certain chemicals (some components of cigarette smoke, for example) increase DNA errors during and after replication
		* Ultraviolet radiation or X-rays also contribute to incorrect base pairing


# L6 Gene Expression
## 1. How are gene expressed
* Central dogma:
	Transcription 
		Information in DNA copied into mRNA
		In eukaryotes, occurs in nucleus, then mRNA moves into cytoplasm
	Translation
		mRNA translated to form polypeptide chains, which fold to form proteins
	
* From DNA ro Proteins
	* The information content of DNA is in the form of specific sequences of nucleotides
	* The DNA inherited by an organism leads to specific traits by dictating the synthesis of proteins
	* Proteins are the links between genotype and phenotype (involved in cell shape, function, reproduction, and synthesis of biomolecules)
	* Gene expression, the process by which DNA directs protein synthesis, includes two stages: transcription and translation
## 2. Transcription
### 2.1 Three types of RNA
* RNA is the intermediate between genes and the proteins for which they code
* Transcription is the synthesis of RNA under the direction of DNA
* Transcription produces three types of RNAs
	Messenger RNA (mRNA): carries DNA gene information to the ribosome
	Transfer RNA (tRNA):brings amino acids to the ribosome
	Ribosomal RNA (rRNA):is part of the structure of ribosomes

### 2.2 Nucleotides in DNA & RNA
* DNA:	DeoxyriboNucleic Acid
  RNA:	RiboNucleic Acid
### 2.3 mRNA
* The base sequence of mRNA carries the information for the amino acid sequence of a protein; Each group of three mRNA bases in a row forms a codon, specify the amino acids
### 2.4 rRNA
* contains ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
	where rRNA catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds, named ribozyme
* rRNA combines with proteins to form ribosomes. The small subunit binds mRNA. The large subunit binds tRNA and catalyzes peptide bond formation beetween amino acids during protein synthesis
### 2.5 tRNA 
* Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid at its 3’ end to a ribosome during protein synthesis (Adapter molecules)
* Each tRNA has 3 exposed bases called anticodon, which pairs with a codon of mRNA, ensuring that the correct amino acid is incorporated into the protein.   
* At least one tRNA assigned to carry each of the 20 amino acids
### 2.6 Transcription Process
Transcription of a DNA gene into RNA has three stages 


	1. Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of DNA near the beginning of a gene, separating the double helix near the promoter.
	2. Elongation: RNA polymerase travels along the DNA template strand (blue), unwinding the DNA double helix and synthesizing RNA by catalyzing the addition of ribose nucleotides into an RNA molecule (red). The nucleotides in the RNA are complementary to the template strand of the DNA.
	3. Termination: At the end of the gene, RNA polymerase encounters a DNA sequence called a termination signal. RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA and releases the RNA molecule. 
	
	* RNA polymerase do not require
any primer.
### 2.7 mRNA Synthesis in Prokaryotic Cells
* All the nucleotides in a gene usually code for the amino acids in a protein; 
* Genes for related functions are adjacent (sit side by side) and are transcribed together
* Because prokaryotes have no nuclear membrane, translation and transcription usually occur at the same place and time.
* Ribosomes begin translation at the free 5’ end of mRNA, even as RNA polymerase is elongating the mRNA at its 3’ end

* mRNA is directly used for protein synthesis in prokaryotes
### 2.8 mRNA synthesis and maturation in eukaryotes
* Each end of a pre-mRNA molecule is modified in a particular way:
The 5' end receives a modified nucleotide 5 cap
The 3' end gets a poly-A tail

* mRNA undergoes maturation steps before it can be used for protein synthesis in eukaryotes
	* Each gene consists of two or more segments of DNA that encode for protein, called exons, that are interrupted by other segments that are not translated, called introns
	* Transcription of a gene produces a very long RNA strand that contains introns and exons, which is often called precursor mRNA, or pre-mRNA
	* More nucleotides are added at the 5’ end and 3’ end of the pre-mRNA molecule, forming a “cap” and “tail”
		* Cap and Tail assist with moving the RNA through the nuclear envelope, to bind the mRNA to a ribosome, and to prevent cellular enzymes from breaking down the mRNA
	* Enzymes in the nucleus cut out the introns and splice together the exons to make mature mRNA
	* The mRNA then exits the nucleus through a nuclear membrane pore and associates with a ribosome
### 2.9 Alternate splicing in eukaryotes
* Exons might combine in different combinations
* Allow different mRNAs and multiple polypeptides from single gene
### 2.10 A summary of transcription
* Like DNA replication
	* Require a template DNA
	* New strand grows in 5' to 3' direction
	* Both happen in the nucleus in eukaryotes
* Unlike DNA replication
	* Only small section (gene) of one strand of DNA as template
	* Only RNA polymerase involved
	* Does not need a primer
	* Product is single strand of RNA instead of two identical DNA
## 3. Translation
### 3.1 Genetic Code
* Base sequence in DNA dictates sequence and type of amino acids in protein
* There are 20 amino acids, but there are only four nucleotide bases in DNA
* The genetic code translates the sequence of bases in nucleic acids into the sequence of amino acids in proteins
* The genetic code uses three bases (a triplet, codon) to specify an amino acid
* Each mRNA also has a start codon (AUG) and one of three stop codons (UAG, UAA, and UGA)

* Redundant but not ambiguous
	* 64 (4^3) codons for 20 amino acids
	* Each codon specifies only one specific amino acid; however, some amino acids are specified by as many as six different codons
* Three stop codons do not specify any amino acid
* Almost universal
	* With few exceptions (some codons in bacteria and human are different), all organisms use same genetic code
### 3.2 Reading Frame
* A reading frame is a way of dividing the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecule into a set of 
* Codons must be read in the correct reading frame (correct groupings) in order for the specified polypeptide to be produced
* A frameshift mutation is a genetic mutation caused by a deletion or insertion in a DNA sequence that shifts the way the sequence is read.
* Complementary Base-Pairing Is Critical to the Process of Decoding Genetic Information
### 3.3 Translaation Process
* Ribosomes, tRNA, and mRNA cooperate in protein synthesis. 
* Like transcription, translation has three steps
	* Initiation
	* Elongation
	* Termination
### 3.4 Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes
* Gene expression is regulated at a number of points
	* Transcription (transcription factors)
	* Post-transcription (alternative splicing)
	* Translation (life span of mRNA)
	* Post-translational modification (protein activity)
	* Life span of proteins (protein degradation)
### 3.5 Genes Regulation in Humans
* The human genome contains ~ 30,000 genes
* A given cell “expresses” (transcribes) only a small number of genes
* Some genes are expressed in all cells
* Other genes are expressed only
	* In certain types of cells
	* At certain times in an organism’s life
	* Under specific environmental conditions
