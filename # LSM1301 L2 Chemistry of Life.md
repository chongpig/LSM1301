# LSM1301 L2 Chemistry of Life
## 1. Organic Molecules
### 
* Contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms
	Linked by covalent bonds
	may also be bonded to other atoms
* Each carbon atom
	Able to bond with up to four atoms
	By single, double or triple bonds
* Carbon atoms 
	Ablee to form chains or rings
### Function groups
Clusters of atoms linked to carbon skeleton
Confer specific chemcal properties to molecules : Reactivity, Polarity
### The four types of organic molecules
* Carbohydrates, Proteins, Lipids, Nucleic Acids
* Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers
	* A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks
	* These small building-block molecules are called monomers
* Three of the four classes of life's organic molecules are polymers: Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids
* Synthesis of Polymers
	* Monomers are joined rogether through dehydration synthesis
* Breakdown of Polymers
	* Polumers are broken apart through hydrolysis
## Carbohydrates
* Composition:
	* C, H, O in ration of 1:2:1
	* Chemical formula $(CH_2O)_n$ _
	* Single sugar : monosaccharide
	* Two sugar : disaccharide
	* Several(3-10) sugars : oligosaccharide
	* Many sugars : polysaccharide
* Function: Energy source and structral support
* Single sugar molecule : eg. Glucose, ribose, deoxyribose, fructose, galactose
	* Most have 5 or 6 carbon backbone
		5 carbon sugars : pentoses
		6 carbon sugars hexoses
	* Usually in ring form in cells
	* Soluble in water
* Disaccharide:
	* Sucrose(table sugar) = glucose + fructose
	* Lactose(milk sugar) = glucose + galactose
	* Maltose(malt sugar) = glucose + glucose
* Polysaccharides
	The designation alpha means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the $-CH_2OH$ group at C-% lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane(a trans arrangement), while beta means that they are on the same side of the plane(a cis arrangement)
	Leaf: Cellulose(beta)
	Potato: Starch(alpha)
	Liver: Glycogen(alpha)
	* Starches:
		* hydrolyze easily in water and acid to give maltose and finally glucose 
		* are digested by the enzymes amylase in saliva and maltase in the intestine
		* mostly linked by alpha 1,4 glycosidic bond
	* Glycogen:
		* Animal starch, stored in liver and muscle
		* hydrolyzed in our cells amd maintains the blood level of glucose and provides energy between meals
		* are joined by alpha 1,4 glycosidic bond and aplha glycosidic bonds(highly branched)
	* Cellulose
		* Major stsructural material of wood and plants, cotton
		* form a long unbramched chain, linkedn by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds
	* Case study: Glycemic Index
## Protein
Proteins are polymers composed of building blocks called amino acids
* Function: Structural , Movement, Defense, Storage, Signaling, Catalyzing reactions
* Amino Acids: Hydrogen, Amino, Carboxyl, "R"
* Protein Synthesis
	* Joined by condensation
		Carboxyl(-COOH) group of ine amino acid with amino(-NH2)group of the next amino acid
		$H_2O$ formed as by-product
	* Result in peptide aas by-product
* Four levels of protein structure:
	1. Primary: consists of a linear sequence of amino acids linked together by poptide bonds
	2. Secondary: the chain twists into a coil, or pleated sheet held by hydrogen bonds
	3. Tertiary: refers to complex foldings of the protein chain held togethere by hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges , and other bonds
	4. Quaternary: in which two or more multiple polypetide chains associate as linked together by hydrogen bonds or disulfide bridges
* The functions of proteins are linked to their three-dimensional structures:
	Precise postioning of amino acid R groups leads to active site and binding site
	Disruption of secondary and tertiary bonds leads to denatured proteins and loss of function
## Lipids 
Organic substances which are insoluble in polaar solvents , such as water. Include : triglycererides(fats and oils), phospholipids, waxes, and steroids
* Fatty acid lipids/ Non-Fatty Acid Lipids
1. Triglycerids(Oils, Fatss):
	Are used primarily as energy-storage molecules, containing twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins
	Are formed by dehydration synthesis
	Three fatty acids + glycerol -> triglyceride
	Saturated fat: mostly all C-C bonds
	Unsaturated fat : many C=C bonds
2. Phospholipids
	The major component of all cell membranes
	Subunits
		One glycerol
		Two fatty acids non-polar and hydrophobic
		Head with phosphate group, polar and hydrophilic
	Formed by condensation
3. Steroids
	Steroids are composed of four carbon rings fused together, with various functional groups protruding from them 
	eg: Cholesterol, Bile salt(cholic acid)

## 1.Cell
### Cell Size
* Most cells are small
* Large surface area needed
* Surface-area-to-volume ratio
### Cell Theory
Three principles comprise cell theory:
* Every living things or organisms are made of one or more cells.
* Cells are functional units of multicellular organism.
* All cells come from pre-existing cells.
### Types of cells
* Prokaryotic(before nucleus)
* Eukaryotic(true nucleus)
### Structure
* Plasma membrane
Encloses cell and keeps cell as distinct entity from environment
Boundary that controls passage of substances in and out of cell
* DNA-Containing region
Nucleus – in eukaryotes
Nucleoid region – in prokaryotes
* Cytoplasm
Fluid portion and structures between plasma membrane and DNA-containing region
Fluid portion contains water, salts and organic molecules – cytosol
Structures with specific functions – organelles
## 2. Cell Membranes
### Membrane Structure
* Fluid mosaic model
Mosaic mixture of phospholipids, steroids and proteins
Constantly drifting and moving within viscous fluid of phospholipid bilayer
* Phospholipid bilayer
Forms selectively permeable barrier
Some are glycolipids, with attached carbohydrate chains
### Membrane Structure(plant cell)
* Associated proteins
Float around like icebergs on sea
Some anchored by protein filaments in cytoplasm
Cell wall outside plasma membrane
Some are partially or wholly embedded in bilayer
Some are temporarily attached to surface of bilayer
### Membrane Structure(animal cell)
* Associated proteins
Responsible for variety of membrane functions – adhesion, enzymes, receptors, recognition, transport.
* Glycoproteins
Carbohydrates attached to protein
### Cell membranes functions
* Plasma membrane
Common to all cells
Separates cell’s internal cytoplasm from external environment
Controls traffic of substances in and out of cell (transporters)
Regulates biochemical reactions (receptors)
Communicates with other cells (glycoproteins)
Creates attachments within (cytoskeleton) and between cells
* Basic structure of all membranes in cells – similar
Bilayer of phospholipids with embedded and attached proteins
### Transport of Substance  Across Membranes
1. Passive transport: no energy required:
	* simple diffusion
	* facilitated diffusion (require protein transporter)
2. Active transport: energy-requiring transport 
	* Such as sodium-potassium pump proteins
### Diffusion
* Diffusion
Net movement of molecules down a concentration gradient (high to low concentration)
* Osmosis – special case of diffusion
Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane down its own concentration gradient
From high water (low solute) concentration to low water (high solute) concentration
### Movement of water across membranes by osmosis
* Isotonic solution
Solute concentration equal on both sides of membrane
* Hypotonic solution
Solute concentration lower than on other side of membrane
* Hypertonic solution
Solute concentration higher than on other side of membrane
### Facilitated difussion
Facilitated diffusion (facilitated transport)
Ions and polar molecules
No energy required
Follow their concentration gradients
Transport proteins (conformational change) required
Specialised water-channel proteins, aquaporins, enhance water transport
### Active Transport
The movement of materials across a membrane through the use of cellular energy, normally against a concentration gradient
Active transport is performed by specific proteins (pump) embedded in the membranes
Active transport allows cells to maintain concentration gradients that differ from their surroundings
   e.g. keep a low concentration of Na+ inside cell even the 
   Na+ concentration is very high outside cell.
### Exocytosis/Endocytosis
* Large substances are transported into or out of cell inside membrane enclosed pouches (vesicles)
Macromolecules and particles too large for transport proteins
Formation and movement of vesicles involve motor proteins and ATP
* Exocytosis
Vesicle fuses with plasma membrane, releasing contents outside cell
* Endocytosis
Small patch of plasma membrane pinched off, forming vesicle, engulfing substances near cell surface, bringing them into cell
### Cell wall
* Relatively stiff structural coating that surround plasma membranes
Strong, flexible and porous
Support and protect fragile cell
* Found in nearly all
Bacteria
Archaea
Protists
Fungi – chitin
Plants – cellulose
## Prokaryotic Cells
* Extremely small
* Specialised surface features
* can take several shapes
### prokayotic cells structure
* Cell envelope:
Cell wall – polysaccharides in bacteria, proteins in archaea
Glycocalyx – polysaccharide coating outside cell wall – slime layer and capsule (harder to remove)
Plasma membrane
* Appendages
Flagella – in some bacteria for motility
Fimbriae (attachment pili) – bristle-like, short and abundant, for adhesion to surfaces
Conjugation pili (sex pili) – tubular, long and fewer, for DNA transfer from cell to cell
* Cytoplasm
Fewer specialised cytoplasmic structures
Nucleoid – irregularly shaped region of single, circular chromosome of DNA molecule
Plasmids – small rings of DNA with few genes that may be advantageous, e.g. resistance to antibiotics
Ribosomes – organelles on which proteins are synthesized
May contain inclusion bodies, e.g. food granules
## 4.Eukaryotic Cells
* Much larger than prokaryotic cells 
* DNA in a nucleus that is bounded by a membranous nuclear envelope 
* Membrane-enclosed organelles result in compartmentalisation
Specialised organelles for specific functions
Types and amounts of substances that enter and exit organelles regulated
Maintains special internal environments
Metabolic reactions isolated from others
### Nucleus
* Control center of the eukaryotic cell (stores DNA)
* Three major components
Nuclear envelope (double membrane)
Chromatin
Nucleolus (carrying genes for ribosomes production)
### Chromatin and Chromosome
Consists of DNA and proteins
Chromatin condenses to form chromosomes during cell division
Chromatin are long thin fibres, but chromosomes are compacted, thick and ribbon-like.
They contain genes that provide a blueprint for a huge variety of proteins
### Chromosomes
* Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus
* Somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) have two sets of chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. 
* Gametes (Gametic cells, reproductive cells: sperm and eggs) have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells
### Endomembrane System (Cell’s Membrane System)
* Components of the endomembrane system:
Nuclear envelope
Endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi apparatus/complex
Lysosomes
Vacuoles
Plasma membrane
* These components are either continuous or connected via transfer by vesicles/vacuoles
* Functions: 
Synthesizes, modifies, and transports proteins
Synthesizes lipids
Detoxifies the cell of certain toxins
### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
* A network of sacs and tubules composed of membranes. This complex organelle originates at the nuclear envelope and winds throughout the cell. 
Two forms
* Rough ER:Flattened sacs
Studded with ribosomes on outer surface
Synthesises, modifies and folds proteins
* Smooth ER
Series of inter-connected tubules
No ribosomes
Synthesises lipids (like steroid hormones made from cholesterol)
Detoxify harmful chemical drugs
### Golgi Complex/Apparatus
* Set of stacked flattened, curved sacs
* Receives material from ER in vesicles
* Modifies some molecules, such as adding a carbohydrate group to proteins, and making glycoproteins; it breaks some proteins into smaller peptides 
* Synthesizes some polysaccharides used in plant cell walls, such as cellulose and pectin
* Sort and Packages finished material in vesicles for shipment to final destinations 
Some within cell
Some exported from cell via exocytosis
### Lysosomes
* Function :
	digest macromolecules
	clean up broken down organelles, bacteria virus
* Structure:
	vesicles of digestive enzymes
### Energy-related Organelles
Mitochondria:The sites of cellular repiration, a metabolic process that generate ATP. function as the powerhouses of the cell
* Mitochondria are in nearly all eukaryotic cells (plant and animal).
* They have a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane folded into cristae.
* Cristae present a large surface area for enzymes that synthesize ATP.
* The inner membrane creates two compartments: intermembrane space and mitochondrial matrix.
* Cellular respiration broke down carbohydrate in the mitochondrial matrix to generate high-energy electron carriers, e.g. NADH.
* The electron transport chain complexes in inner membrane transfer electron from NADH to O2 and generate ATP.

Chloroplast: found in plants and algae are the sites of photosynthesis
Both organelles have their own DNA
* Chloroplasts are only found in plant cell.
* Thylakoid membranes contains chlorophyll pigment that carry out light reaction converting light energy to chemical energy, e.g. ATP
* Stroma is the site for dark reaction, using ATP to synthesize carbohydrate from CO2 and water.
### Cytoskeleton
* Microfilament is comprised of actin and provide internal support to the cell shape.
* Microfilament can extend by adding subunits at one end and releasing subunits at the other end to allow cell movement.

* Microtubule is associated with motor proteins to transport organelles within the cell.
* Microtubule also guide chromosome movements during cell division.
