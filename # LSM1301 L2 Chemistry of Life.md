# LSM1301 L2 Chemistry of Life
## 1. Organic Molecules
### 
* Contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms
	Linked by covalent bonds
	may also be bonded to other atoms
* Each carbon atom
	Able to bond with up to four atoms
	By single, double or triple bonds
* Carbon atoms 
	Ablee to form chains or rings
### Function groups
Clusters of atoms linked to carbon skeleton
Confer specific chemcal properties to molecules : Reactivity, Polarity
### The four types of organic molecules
* Carbohydrates, Proteins, Lipids, Nucleic Acids
* Macromolecules are polymers, built from monomers
	* A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar building blocks
	* These small building-block molecules are called monomers
* Three of the four classes of life's organic molecules are polymers: Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids
* Synthesis of Polymers
	* Monomers are joined rogether through dehydration synthesis
* Breakdown of Polymers
	* Polumers are broken apart through hydrolysis
## Carbohydrates
* Composition:
	* C, H, O in ration of 1:2:1
	* Chemical formula $(CH_2O)_n$ _
	* Single sugar : monosaccharide
	* Two sugar : disaccharide
	* Several(3-10) sugars : oligosaccharide
	* Many sugars : polysaccharide
* Function: Energy source and structral support
* Single sugar molecule : eg. Glucose, ribose, deoxyribose, fructose, galactose
	* Most have 5 or 6 carbon backbone
		5 carbon sugars : pentoses
		6 carbon sugars hexoses
	* Usually in ring form in cells
	* Soluble in water
* Disaccharide:
	* Sucrose(table sugar) = glucose + fructose
	* Lactose(milk sugar) = glucose + galactose
	* Maltose(malt sugar) = glucose + glucose
* Polysaccharides
	The designation alpha means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the $-CH_2OH$ group at C-% lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane(a trans arrangement), while beta means that they are on the same side of the plane(a cis arrangement)
	Leaf: Cellulose(beta)
	Potato: Starch(alpha)
	Liver: Glycogen(alpha)
	* Starches:
		* hydrolyze easily in water and acid to give maltose and finally glucose 
		* are digested by the enzymes amylase in saliva and maltase in the intestine
		* mostly linked by alpha 1,4 glycosidic bond
	* Glycogen:
		* Animal starch, stored in liver and muscle
		* hydrolyzed in our cells amd maintains the blood level of glucose and provides energy between meals
		* are joined by alpha 1,4 glycosidic bond and aplha glycosidic bonds(highly branched)
	* Cellulose
		* Major stsructural material of wood and plants, cotton
		* form a long unbramched chain, linkedn by beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds
	* Case study: Glycemic Index
## Protein
Proteins are polymers composed of building blocks called amino acids
* Function: Structural , Movement, Defense, Storage, Signaling, Catalyzing reactions
* Amino Acids: Hydrogen, Amino, Carboxyl, "R"
* Protein Synthesis
	* Joined by condensation
		Carboxyl(-COOH) group of ine amino acid with amino(-NH2)group of the next amino acid
		$H_2O$ formed as by-product
	* Result in peptide aas by-product
* Four levels of protein structure:
	1. Primary: consists of a linear sequence of amino acids linked together by poptide bonds
	2. Secondary: the chain twists into a coil, or pleated sheet held by hydrogen bonds
	3. Tertiary: refers to complex foldings of the protein chain held togethere by hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges , and other bonds
	4. Quaternary: in which two or more multiple polypetide chains associate as linked together by hydrogen bonds or disulfide bridges
* The functions of proteins are linked to their three-dimensional structures:
	Precise postioning of amino acid R groups leads to active site and binding site
	Disruption of secondary and tertiary bonds leads to denatured proteins and loss of function
## Lipids 
Organic substances which are insoluble in polaar solvents , such as water. Include : triglycererides(fats and oils), phospholipids, waxes, and steroids
* Fatty acid lipids/ Non-Fatty Acid Lipids
1. Triglycerids(Oils, Fatss):
	Are used primarily as energy-storage molecules, containing twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins
	Are formed by dehydration synthesis
	Three fatty acids + glycerol -> triglyceride
	Saturated fat: mostly all C-C bonds
	Unsaturated fat : many C=C bonds
2. Phospholipids
	The major component of all cell membranes
	Subunits
		One glycerol
		Two fatty acids non-polar and hydrophobic
		Head with phosphate group, polar and hydrophilic
	Formed by condensation
3. Steroids
	Steroids are composed of four carbon rings fused together, with various funcctional groups protruding from them 
	eg: Cholesterol, Bile salt(cholic acid)
